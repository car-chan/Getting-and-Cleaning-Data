Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: Tidying the Dataset 
Version 1.0
==================================================================

This respository contains:
1. a script run_analysis.R that outputs a tidy dataset using the training and test datasets from the link here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ;and,

2. A codebook that describes the variables, the data, and transformations 

A brief description of the data is below: 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The script merges and summarizes the training and test datasets. The script should run as long as the Samsung data is the working directory.
